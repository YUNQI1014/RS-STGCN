# This file lists the Python packages required to run the EEG emotion recognition project.
# You can install all dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# --- Core ML & Data Handling ---
# Pinning to specific versions for reproducibility.
numpy==1.26.4
pandas==2.1.4
scikit-learn==1.3.0
scipy==1.11.4
tqdm==4.66.1

# --- Deep Learning & Graph Neural Networks ---
torch==2.1.0
torch-geometric==2.4.0


# --- PyTorch & Geometric Deep Learning ---
# NOTE: The installation of PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric can be environment-specific,
# especially if you are using a GPU with CUDA.
# For a seamless installation, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to install PyTorch first,
# following the official instructions for your specific system (Linux/Windows, CUDA version).
#
# 1. Install PyTorch: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
#    (Example for a recent Linux CUDA version: pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio)
#
# 2. After installing PyTorch, the command below should correctly install PyG and its dependencies.
